We implemented this 'Awake' method in our code to ensure that our AudioManager code exists throughout all the scenes. https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Awake.html

We implemented the quit application so users can quit the application when its in unity, so you can close the application
https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Application.Quit.html

We implemented this code to prevent our Asteroid objects from rotating
https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Quaternion-identity.html

DontDestroyOnLoad() will ensure that the audio wont be reloaded or reset when switching scenes.
